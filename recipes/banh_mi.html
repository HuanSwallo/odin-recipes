    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all of your ingredients together.</li>
        <li>Get saucepan and combine rice vinegar, sugar, and water. Bring to boil over medium heat and stir until sugar has dissolved for 1 minute. Let the mixture cool.</li>
        <li>Get bowl and place carrot, radish and onion. Pour in cooled vinegar mixture and let marinate for at least 30 minutes. While vegetables marinate, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the boiler. Lightly oil a slotted broiler pan.</li>
        <li>Get chicken breast and sprinkle with garlic salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place chicken on prepared pan and broil, turning once, until browned and no longer pink in the center for about 6 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Place chicken on cutting board and cut into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Slice baguette in half lengthwise. Pull out the soft center of bread which leave space for the fillings.</li>
        <li>Lightly toast baguette under the broiler for 2 to 3 mintues.</li>
        <li>Drain off excess vinegar mixture after vegetables have marinated.</li>
        <li>Now to assemble the sandwich, spread each half of toasted bagutte with mayonnaise. Layer chicken on the bottom half of the bread. Top with cucumber, drained pickled vegetables, cilantro, and jalapeño. Squeeze lime wedge over fillings and cover with top half of baguette.</li>
        <li>Cut into two 6-inch sandwiches to serve and enjoy!</li>
